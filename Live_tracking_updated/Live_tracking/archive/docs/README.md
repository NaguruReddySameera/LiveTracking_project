Why archived

- These files are primarily reference and historical documentation not required for day-to-day development or deployment.
- They were moved to keep the repo focused on `frontend/` and `backend/` as the active, deployable components.

How to restore

- To restore a file, move it out of `archive/docs/` back to the root and update any references in the `README.md` or other docs.

If you want a subset kept in the root (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT.md`), tell me and I'll move it back or keep it outside of `archive/`.
